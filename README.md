# LIRC Configuration Repository
## About

This repository contains pre-recorded codes for a few devices.
These recordings are not entirely thorough, but are good enough for most use
cases.

I collected these codes using every source I found available.

## Installation

Copy relevant files from `codes` subdirectory to `/etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/`
subfolder.

## Copying
